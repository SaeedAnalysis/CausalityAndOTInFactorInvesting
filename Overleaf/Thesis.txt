\abstract{Factor investing research has uncovered many return-predictive "factors," but many identified relationships may be only correlations rather than true causal drivers of returns. This thesis investigates whether advanced causal discovery methods can distinguish genuine factor causality from spurious correlations in financial markets. We develop a synthetic dataset of stock returns with embedded causal relationships among four common equity factors (value, size, momentum, volatility) and implement treatment interventions to test causal inference methods. We then apply these methods to real Fama-French factor data spanning 1963-2025. We apply a complete suite of causal inference methods, including difference-in-differences (DiD), changes-in-changes (CiC), matching, instrumental variables (IV), and pairwise causal discovery (Additive Noise Models and DIVOT). By incorporating OT, we capture distributional effects beyond simple averages and improve covariate balance in matching. Our synthetic data results demonstrate that OT-augmented methods successfully identify true factor-return causal links, confirming momentum and size factors as genuine drivers while correctly recognising a placebo "value" factor as spurious. However, application to real financial data reveals the complexity of actual markets: while natural experiments (such as the dot-com bubble and financial crisis) provide clear causal evidence through DiD analysis, general causal discovery methods return largely inconclusive results, highlighting the nuanced, time-varying nature of factor-return relationships. We further document regime-dependent factor effects, showing dramatic changes in factor behaviour across market conditions. The study concludes that while causal discovery approaches show promise for controlled synthetic environments, real-world factor causality requires careful event-based identification strategies rather than purely algorithmic approaches.}
