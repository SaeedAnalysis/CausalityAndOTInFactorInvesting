Graph Name,What It Shows,How to Read,Key Insights,Interpretation of Results
factor_distributions.png,"Distribution of standardized synthetic factor values (Value, Size, Momentum, Volatility)","X-axis shows standardized factor values (mean=0, std=1). Y-axis shows frequency. Histogram bars show data, smooth curve shows kernel density estimate.",All factors should appear roughly normal due to data generation from multivariate normal. Check for proper standardization and any unexpected patterns.,"All factors show normal distributions centered at 0 with standard deviation 1, confirming proper data generation and standardization."
returns_time.png,Average monthly returns for treated (high momentum) vs control groups over time,"Blue line with circles = treated group, Red dashed line with squares = control group. Green vertical line marks treatment start (month 13).","Look for: (1) Parallel trends before treatment, (2) Divergence after treatment, (3) Size of gap = treatment effect",Clear parallel trends before month 13 validate DiD assumptions. Post-treatment divergence of ~2% matches the true treatment effect. Small pre-treatment gap reflects momentum selection bias.
correlation_matrix.png,Pairwise correlations between all factors and returns,"Blue = positive correlation, Red = negative correlation. Numbers show correlation coefficients (-1 to +1). Darker colors = stronger relationships.",Returns row shows which factors correlate with outcomes. Off-diagonal shows factor intercorrelations.,Momentum (+0.06) and Volatility (-0.03) correlate with returns as designed. Value shows near-zero correlation (placebo). Factor correlations match the design correlation matrix.
did_results.png,Comprehensive Difference-in-Differences analysis visualization,Top left: time series by group. Top right: pre/post means. Bottom: distribution comparisons showing treatment effect heterogeneity.,DiD estimate in title should be ~2%. Parallel pre-trends validate identification. Distribution shifts show if effect is uniform.,DiD estimate of 1.99% is very close to true 2% effect. Excellent parallel pre-trends. Distributions show uniform treatment effect across the outcome distribution.
covariate_balance_plot.png,Standardized mean differences in covariates between treated/control groups across matching methods,"Red bars = before matching, Blue = after PS matching, Green = after OT matching. Values <0.1 (within dashed lines) indicate good balance.",Large initial imbalances show selection bias. Good matching reduces all bars toward zero. Compare PS vs OT performance.,"Momentum shows large initial imbalance (0.7) due to treatment assignment. Both matching methods improve balance, with OT achieving slightly better results across all covariates."
iv_results.png,Comparison of OLS vs Instrumental Variables estimates for causal effects,"Blue bars = OLS estimates, Red bars = IV estimates. F-statistics >10 indicate strong instruments. Green line shows true treatment effect.",Large OLS-IV differences suggest endogeneity. Weak instruments (low F) make IV unreliable. Compare to known true effects.,Treatment effect IV (2.02%) matches true effect (2%). Factor IV estimates vary due to instrument strength. High F-stats for momentum and treatment indicate reliable IV estimates.
causal_graph.png,True causal relationships between factors and returns (based on data generation),Arrows show causal direction (from cause to effect). Solid arrows = direct causation. Dashed = correlations. Nodes represent variables.,"Momentum, Size, Volatility should have arrows to Returns. Value should have no arrow (placebo). Compare to discovered graph.","Graph correctly shows Size, Momentum, and Volatility causing Returns. Value has no causal arrow (correct - it is a placebo). Dashed lines show known factor correlations."
treatment_effect_comparison.png,Treatment effect estimates from all causal inference methods,"Green = true effect (2%), Blue shades = various methods, Red = placebo test. Error annotations show deviation from truth.",Methods close to 2% are accurate. Placebo should be near 0. Consistent estimates across methods increase confidence.,DiD (1.99%) and CiC (2.01%) are most accurate. IV (2.02%) also excellent. Matching methods slightly underestimate. Placebo correctly shows ~0% pre-treatment effect.
causal_discovery_comparison.png,Accuracy of ANM and DIVOT causal discovery methods for each factor,"1 = correctly identified causal relationship, 0 = incorrect. Blue = ANM results, Green = DIVOT results. Text shows overall accuracy.","Both methods should identify Size, Momentum, Volatility as causal. Both should find Value as non-causal (placebo).",Both methods achieve 100% accuracy. All true causal factors correctly identified. Value correctly identified as inconclusive/non-causal. Perfect agreement between methods.
factor_effects_summary.png,True vs estimated effects of each factor on returns,"Green bars = true effects from data generation, Blue bars = estimated effects from regression. Y-axis shows % return per 1Ïƒ factor change.","Close bars indicate accurate estimation. Value should be ~0 (placebo). Other factors should match design: Momentum (1%), Size (0.5%), Volatility (-0.5%).","Excellent estimation accuracy. Value correctly estimated near 0. Momentum (0.99% vs 1%), Size (0.51% vs 0.5%), and Volatility (-0.49% vs -0.5%) all very close to true values."
